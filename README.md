# What is this? 

This is an _interactive quine_. A source code readout of an HTML document is presented to you as a to-do list application, but the 
interface is the source code itself. That is, clicking on a `<button>` to add a to-do item will add that to-do item, which itself
manifests as a `<li>` node. Once you're done making your list, you can export it as HTML—thereby cloning the application and its
state.

I developed this quine while in residency at the Recurse Center in 2024. For more information see: https://www.pbt.dev/blog/quine/.
